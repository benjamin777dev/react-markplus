## Todo

- Write Playwright tests
- Replace mermaid with lightweight alternatives
- Make an app for ebook authoring
- Create a VS Code extension
- Release a React library so that everyone can use it easily
  - a few lines of code to embed mdp to their own app
- Close most GitHub issues
- Do not use element ids so that we can have multiple components in the same page.
