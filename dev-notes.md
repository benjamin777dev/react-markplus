- No [abbreviation](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#abbr) support, because prettier will replace "\*" with "\_" which will break abbreviation.

## Todo

- Write Playwright tests
- Replace mermaid with lightweight alternatives
- Make an app for ebook authoring
- Create a VS Code extension
- Release a React library so that everyone can use it easily
  - a few lines of code to embed mdp to their own app
- Close most GitHub issues
- rename to MarkPlus? markplus.io
- querySelector, what if there are multiple editors in the same page?
  - it may select the wrong element

## Notes

- We use scoped CSS modules so that we could have multiple editors on the same page without confliction.
